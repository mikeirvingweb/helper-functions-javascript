# Helper Functions for JavaScript (plus jQuery)
Common functionality I use in JavaScript (plus jQuery) to help me with common data and environment issues.

As I work in multiple languages, *regularly*, I often write snippets of code to provide functionality *similar* to I'm used to in the other languages.

I have tried to divide the functions up by usage type:

*browser-and-device.js* 📱
*date-functions.js* 📅
*element-functions.js* 🧪
*string-functions.js* 🧵
*time-functions.js* ⏲

Also included is *jquery-3.6.0.min.js* as some of the functionality requires jQuery.

I expect to add to these functions over time, and functions may get moved between files, or placed into new files, as appropriate.

Feel free to add or amend.
